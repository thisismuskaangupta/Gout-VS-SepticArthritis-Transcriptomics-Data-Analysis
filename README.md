# Gout-VS-SepticArthritis-Transcriptomics-Data-Analysis
this contains the code written for the MSc Bioinformatics course - Statistics and Data Analysis for Bioinformatics. grade: B1:17

Can Septic Arthritis and Gout be differentiated based on their transcriptional profiles in blood?

Input Required for code (provided in 'inputs' folder:
1) Expression Table with sample names as column names and gene IDs as row names
2) Sample Metadata
3) Annotations table
4) Differential Tables between two conditions (generated for one comparison, 2 were given)

What the code does:
1) relevant histograms are created
2) PCA is carried out
3) volcano plots are created
4) correlation tests are done between various genes and conditions
5) correlations are represented using scatterplots
6) further DE analysis is done.
